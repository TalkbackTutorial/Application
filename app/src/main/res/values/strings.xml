    <string name="article_author">Author: Billy Eggman</string>
    <string name="article_paragraph1">Within the cerebral cortex, the frontal and temporal lobes are heavily involved in explicit/declarative memory processes. Episodic memories tent to be stored in the frontal lobe (particularly the pre-frontal cortex) and temporal lobe. The same can be assumed with semantic memories. Components of our memories such as visuals and sounds are stored in areas throughout the cerebral cortex. Sound is sotred in the temporal lobe, while visuals in the occipital lobe.</string>
    <string name="article_paragraph2">The hippocampus (in temporal lobe) consolidates memories, turning short term memories into long term declarative memories; semantic and episodic. It also has roles in emotional memory due to its proximity to the amygdala, and spatial memory.</string>
    <string name="article_paragraph3">The amygdala (in temporal lobe) is involved in emotional memory, and links emotions and emotional responses (such as fear and aggression) to declarative memories. This helps us remember experiences by the emotion we felt during its formation. Also involved in the formation of procedural memories.</string>
    <string name="article_paragraph4">The cerebellum is involved in motor learning and the memory of conditioned reflexes. It\'s involved in implicit memory such as procedural memories that require movement. Also has a role in spatial navigation.</string>
    <string name="article_paragraph5">Finally, language is stored in Broca\'s area in the left frontal lobe, and memory for pictures are stored in the occipital lobe.</string>
