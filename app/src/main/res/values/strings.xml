    <string name="adjust_reading_controls_part1_intro">This module covers how to adjust TalkBack\'s reading controls, which lets us make TalkBack read and navigate in different ways. When you change modes, TalkBack will speak the mode you switched to.</string>
    <string name="adjust_reading_controls_part1_prompt">To change your mode, swipe up and down in one motion. Try to go through all of the options before moving on.</string>
    <string name="adjust_reading_controls_part1_backwards_prompt">You can go backwards through the list. Swipe down then up in one motion to go through the list in the opposite direction.</string>
    <string name="adjust_reading_controls_part1_multi_finger">Modes can also be switched by swiping with three fingers horizontally either to the left or to the right. Try going through the list with three finger swipes in both directions before moving on.</string>
